1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

                             HTTP

HTTP-Hyper Text Trasfer Protocol.HTTPis the set of rules for  transfering files.
such as test,image,video,audio and other mulltimedia files.
HTTP is an application protocol that runs on top of the TCP/IP protocols.                                          
It is used to client-sever communication.
The browser builds an HTTP request and sends it to the Internet 
Protocol address (IP address) indicated by the URL.

                             How HTTP WORKS?

User send request of image data to the server.
Server response ang  give back the image data to the user on the screen.
Request and Responce are loaded in the web page.
That web page have many links.

                            HTTP1.1
HTTP/1.1 It is developed by Timothy Berners-Lee in 1989 as a 
communication for the world wide web.
several requests & responses are merged in a single connection. 
These are the drawbacks ofHTTP1.1 
HTTP/1.1 transfer all the requests & responses in the plain text
message form.line blocking in which TCP connection is blocked
all other requests until the response does not receive. 
All the information related to the header file 
repeated in every request.

                          HTTP 2
HTTP/2 was developed over the SPDY protocol.
HTTP/2 works on the binary framing layer instead of textual 
that converts all the messages in binary format. 
it works on fully multiplexed that is one TCP connection.
It is used for multiple requests.


HTTP/1.1 vs. HTTP/2:  differences

                        COMPRESSION:
  
 HTTP/2 is compressing more range of different headers,
caching directives and client information..
But HTTP/1.1 does not compress headers by default.

                      PERFORMANCE

Many of the new features in HTTP/2 
improving performance for the end-user.
HTTP/1.1 does not have these advanced features.

             
   
                          
                      SECURITY

The binary format used by HTTP/2, there is no longer a 
risk with so-called response splitting attacks 
that are possible with HTTP/1.1.

                          
                      DELIVERY MODELS

The HTTP/1.1 protocol delivers responses based on a single request, 
HTTP/2 uses multiplexing and server push features to increase the delivery performance.
                          
            
                         
                 MULTIPLEXING

Can be used to send multiple requests and receive 
multiple responses IN HTTP/2.
HTTP/1.1 does not support multiplexing.


              




2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript


                  OBJECTS:

Objects is a key and value pairs
Objects is a collection of values.
This values are Primitive or Reference values
This values idetifiers name is properties.

       There are three ways to create odjects.

1. Object literal
2. Creating instance of Object directly
3. Using an Object constructor.

               1. Object literal:

var obj={name:"sree",id:23451; age:25;}
console.log(obj);
Property and value is separated by :(colon)


                2. Creating instance of Object directly

var objName=new Object();
new keyword is used to create object directly.

var stu=new Object();
stu.name="sree";
stu.id=23451;
stu.age=25;
console.log(stu);

                  3. Using an Object constructor.

To create function with arguments.
Every argument value can be assigned in the current object by using THIS keyword.

function stu(name,id,age){
this.name=name;
this.id=id;
this.age=age;
}
s=new stu(23451,"sree", 25);
console.log(s);


                      Defining method in Object


function stu(name,id,age){
this.name=name;
this.id=id;
this.age=age;

this.changeName=changeName;
function changeName(otherName){
this.name=otherName;
}
}
s=new stu("brindha",23451,25);
console.log(s);
